Hey! I'm Garbage Disposal Protogen! (GrinDIR) I am a Linux user, and I like to make/host Discord Bots for my Frens!
I'm a Furry (Protogen, male), and my interests are: Furries, Linux, Code, Music, Tech, Networking, and especcialy Waste Disposal.
I mainly use Github to store my code as a backup, and so it can be accessed on a hosting site.
Thanks for checking me out, and if you'd like me to maybe make you a free bot, find me on Discord (Garbage Disposal Protogen#5779) and Reddit (Trashy Protogen)
I know Linux, Bash, Python, and a little bit of JavaScript
